Problem: Audio Player with Adapter Design Pattern

You are designing a media player application. The core system supports playback for .mp3 files.
However, there is an existing legacy media library that can play .mp4 and .vlc files through
different methods, but it does not support .mp3. You want to make your system capable of
playing .mp4 and .vlc files without modifying the legacy code.
